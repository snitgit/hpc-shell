This workshop is an introduction to using high-performance computing systems
effectively. We obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course
on parallel programming in just two days of teaching time. Instead, this
workshop is intended to give students a good introduction and overview of the
tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Use the UNIX command line (also known as terminal or shell) to operate a
  computer, connect to a cluster, and write simple shell scripts.
